    <h1> Events and event Listeners </h1>
    <h3>Events in JavaScript refers to actions or occurrences that happen on a web page, such as a mouse click, a keyboard press, or a page load.Events are important
        in JavaScript because they allow us to create dynamic and interactive web pages. That means without events, web pages would be static and unresponsive. </h3>
    <h3>Event listeners are functions that are called when a particular event is triggered. </h3>
    
    <!-- <button id="myButton"> Click Me! </button> -->

    <input id="searchBox" type="text"/>

    <script>
        
        // const button = document.querySelector('#myButton');

        // Next we can attach an event listener. So we can say button.addEventListener. It takes two arguments. First, the type of the event that is click in our case, 
        // and a callback function. This callback function runs as soon as it triggers this particular event. 
        
        
        // button.addEventListener('click',() =>{
        //     alert("Hello World")
        // })

        //*key press events 

        const searchBox = document.querySelector('#searchBox');

        searchBox.addEventListener('keyup',() => {
            console.log('event triggered')
        })

    </script>
